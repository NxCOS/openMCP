To get the genDB.py to connect correctly, install the follwing:
 
 - Python 3 (version >= 3.5.x)
   - PyMySQL Library (version >= 0.7.11)
 - mysql-common
 - mysql-server
 - mysql-client 

After 'mysql' packages are installed and root password chosen, run:

mysql -u root -p 

## ** Enter the root password you just created during the install ** ##
## ** Note: the ';' symbol means end of line, Press Enter ** ##

mysql> CREATE DATABASE openmcp;  ## ** This will create the Database ** ##
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON openmcp.* TO '<USERNAME>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>'; 

## ** Put the username you wish to sign in with in <USERNAME> (No <>) and choose a password to login with in,
      <PASSWORD> (No <>) ** ##
## ** If you wish to access this database from another system, replace 'localhost' with the IP of the source,
      system and make sure firewall rules will not block requests. Also make sure to comment out the,
      "bind-address" line in your system mysql config with a # at the beginning of the line (Common Config File,
      Location: '/etc/mysql/my.cnf') and restart the service ** ##

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  ## ** This will apply our permission changes, no service restart needed ** ##

mysql> exit

## ** You should now be ready to run genDB.py to auto-edit the database to the default configuration ** ##
